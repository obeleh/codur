Fix the bugs in @main.py. The edit_distance function has issues with the memoization and the edit operation calculation.

The function should correctly compute the Levenshtein distance (minimum edit distance) between two strings.
Read the docstring carefully to understand the algorithm.

Run @main.py to verify the output matches expected.txt.
